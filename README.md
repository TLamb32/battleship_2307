1 .Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you would’ve approached the design and problem solving process.

While the iteration 3 interaction pattern isn't laid out like the previous two, it still reads like one. We referred to the headers of the various sections as if they were method names, determined the functionality of each one, and built from there. Worth noting, we built each method, checked its functionality, and then had to reorganize the actual method code blocks within the loops to attain the wanted effect of the full game.

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

Trying to find a way to refactor some of the helper methods within the board.rb class. It can look messy and hard to read and could potentially be more organized / more concise.
After that, we'd like to utilize more time to "beautify" the project and add some more effects to the game play.

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

We spent a lot of time using the driver / navigator method and ping-pong'ing back and forth.

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

We offered a lot of real time feedback within slack and or study hall calls. We also offered feed back in PR comments and single line comments.
